In this project, We learned data wrangling and visualization skills while examining the real estate market in Mexico. We build on those skills and move from descriptive to predictive data science. Our focus is real estate, but now we need to create a machine-learning model that predicts apartment prices in Buenos Aires, Argentina.


### Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:
- How to create a linear regression model using the `scikit-learn` library.
- How to build a data pipeline for imputing missing values and encoding categorical features.
- How to improve model performance by reducing overfitting.
- How to create a dynamic dashboard for interacting with your completed model.

  
### This project consists of 5 Notebooks:
1. Predicting Price with Size
2. Predicting Price with Location
3. Predicting Price with Neighborhood
4. Predicting Price with Size, Location, and Neighborhood
5. Predicting Apartment Prices in Mexico City
