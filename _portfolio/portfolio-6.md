title: "Air Quality in Nairobi"
excerpt: "This project provides a valuable solution for improving air quality management in major African cities, namely Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam. Leveraging data from openAfrica, we developed a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day, offering actionable insights for local governments, environmental agencies, and health organizations. It empowers decision-makers to implement targeted interventions, reduce pollution levels, and enhance public health, addressing critical air quality concerns across these urban centers.<br/><img src='/images/Factory.jpeg' width='400px' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>"

In this project, you'll work with data from one of Africa's largest open data platforms,Â openAfrica. You'll look at air quality data from Nairobi, Lagos, and Dar es Salaam; and build a time series model to predict PM 2.5 readings throughout the day.

### Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:
- How to get data by querying a MongoDB database.
- How to prepare time series data for analysis.
- How to build an autoregression model.
- How to improve a model by tuning its hyperparameters.

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks:
1. Wrangling Data with MongoDB
2. Linear Regression with Time
3. Autoregressive Models
4. ARMA Models and Hyperparameter Tuning
5. Air Quality in Dar es Salaam
