title: "Customer Segmentation in the US"
excerpt: "This project leverages 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances data and unsupervised learning to identify credit-constrained households. With broad implications, it empowers financial services, marketing, credit scoring, policymakers, and researchers to enhance financial inclusion, precision, and understanding. Its goal is to boost access, engagement, and informed choices while aiding underserved households.<br/><img src='/images/Customer Segmentation.jpeg' width='400px' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>"

In this project, we'll use data from theÂ [2019 Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm). First, you'll identify households that have a hard time getting credit. Then we'll build a model to segment these households into subgroups. Finally, you'll create an interactive web app to share our work.

This project is an example ofÂ **unsupervised learning**, specificallyÂ **clustering**. It can be used in commercial contexts forÂ [marketing or customer segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation)Â or in sociological contexts to studyÂ [social stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification).

### We were able to:      
- Compare characteristics across subgroups using aÂ **side-by-side bar chart**.
- Build aÂ **k-means**Â clustering model.
- ConductÂ **feature selection**Â for clustering based on variance.
- Reduce high-dimensional data usingÂ **principal component analysis (PCA)**.
- Design, build and deploy a DashÂ **web application**.

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks:
1. Exploring the Data
2. Clustering with Two Features
3. Clustering with Multiple Features
4. Interactive Dashboard
5. Small Business Owners in the United StatesðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
