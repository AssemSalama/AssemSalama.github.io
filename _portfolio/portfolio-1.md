title: "Market Forecasting in India"
excerpt: "This project is providing a tool for financial professionals and investors to predict and manage stock market volatility in the Indian market. By creating a model to forecast volatility, individuals and organizations can make more informed investment decisions and potentially reduce the financial risks associated with market fluctuations. This can be particularly valuable for traders, portfolio managers, and investors looking to optimize their strategies and minimize losses.<br/><img src='/images/CBOE Volatility Index.jpeg'>"

In this project, I created a model to predict stock market volatility in India and then deployed our model as a web server.
We built a model to predict volatility on the Bombay Stock Exchange.

First, you explored stock data for two companies using theÂ [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)Â stock API. Then we used that data to calculate volatility and build a model to predict it. Finally, you deployed our model by creating an API to serve predictions.

We were able to:
- Get data from a web API by makingÂ **HTTP requests**.
- Transform and load data into aÂ **SQL database**Â usingÂ **custom Python classes**.
- CalculateÂ **asset volatility**Â and build aÂ **GARCH model**Â to predict it.
- Build your ownÂ **web API and server**Â to serve your modelâ€™s predictions.

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks :
1. Working with APIs
2. Test-Driven Development
3. Predicting Volatility Via GARCH
4. Model Deployment
5. Volatility Forecasting in South Africa

title: "A/B Testing at WorldQuant University"
excerpt: "This project aims to address the challenge of low completion rates for the admissions quiz in the Data Science Lab (DS Lab) program at WQU. The primary business problem is a substantial number of applicants not finishing the quiz, which can lead to reduced enrollment, inefficient resource allocation, and potential impacts on the quality of admitted students. The project involves a multi-step approach, including the exploration of applicant distribution worldwide using a choropleth map, formulating a research question and hypothesis, conducting an A/B test to identify strategies for improving quiz completion, analyzing results using a chi-square test, and finally, creating an interactive web application for others to replicate the experiment. The expected outcomes include increased quiz completion rates, resulting in higher enrollment, better resource management, and improved student quality, ultimately benefiting the DS Lab program at WQU.<br/><img src='/images/AB-Test.jpg'>"

In this project, WQU needs our help to improve its programs! The team have noticed that many applicants to the DS Lab never complete the admissions quiz. In this project, We'll design and conduct an experiment to see if we can increase quiz completion.

First, we'll explore the DS Lab applicant pool, and formulate a research question and hypothesis. Then we'll run our experiment and analyze the results. Finally, we'll build an interactive web application so that others can run the same experiment.

This project is an example ofÂ **A/B testing**, also known as a randomized controlled experiment. In the private sector, A/B tests are used to improve things like email marketing and product pricing. In politics, they can be used to test campaign messages. Scientists of all kinds use them in their research.

We were able to:
- Build aÂ **choropleth map**Â to show the distribution of ADSL students around the world.
- Create aÂ **custom Python class**Â to implementÂ **ETL processes**.
- Design an experiment and analyze the results using aÂ **chi-square test**.
- Build an interactive web application that follows aÂ **three-tiered design pattern**.

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks :
1. Meet the DS Lab Applicants
2. Extract, Transform, and Loa
3. Chi-square test
4. Experiment Web Application
5. Admissions in the MScFE ðŸŽ“ðŸ—ž
