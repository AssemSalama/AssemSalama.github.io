title: "Supply Chain Operations at Faasos"
excerpt: "This project explores the fictional food delivery service, Faasos, using a SQLite database. It covers three main areas: database setup and data insertion, answering a wide range of business questions, including roll metrics and driver/customer experience. The project showcases the ability to clean and analyze data, create SQL queries, and derive valuable insights.<br/><img src='/images/Premium Vector _ Food delivery.jpeg' width='400px' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>"

The Faasos is a food delivery service, and our task was to help optimize their supply chain operations. We needed to write complex SQL queries to analyze past order data, forecast demand, and recommend inventory management strategies. This project involves advanced data analysis and leverages SQL skills to the fullest.


## The questions tackled in this project :
The heart of this project is answering business questions through SQL queries. These questions are divided into four main segments:

### A) Roll Metrics
1. How many rolls were ordered?
2. How many unique customer orders were made?
3. How many successful orders were delivered by each driver?
4. How many of each type of rolls were successfully delivered?
5. How many Veg and non-Veg rolls were ordered by each customer?
6. What was the maximum number of rolls delivered in a single order?
7. For each customer, how many delivered rolls had at least one change and how many had no changes?
8. How many rolls were delivered that had both exclusions and extras?
9. What was the total number of rolls ordered for each hour of the day?
10. What was the number of orders for each day of the week?
    
### B) Driver & Customer Experience
1. What was the average time in minutes it took for each driver to arrive at Faasos HQ to pick up an order?
2. Is there any relationship between the Num of rolls and how long the order takes to be ready?
3. What was the average distance travelled for each customer?
4. What was the differnce between the longest and shortest delivery times for all orders?
5. What was the average speed for each driver for each delivery and is there  any trend for these values?
6. What is the successful delivery percentage for each driver?
