title: "A/B Testing at WorldQuant University"
excerpt: "This project aims to address the challenge of low completion rates for the admissions quiz in the Data Science Lab (DS Lab) program at WQU. The primary business problem is a substantial number of applicants not finishing the quiz, which can lead to reduced enrollment, inefficient resource allocation, and potential impacts on the quality of admitted students. The expected outcomes include increased quiz completion rates, resulting in higher enrollment, better resource management, and improved student quality, ultimately benefiting the DS Lab program at WQU.<br/><img src="/images/AB-Test (Small).jpg" alt="A/B Testing" width="400" />"

In this project, WQU needs our help to improve its programs! The team have noticed that many applicants to the DS Lab never complete the admissions quiz. In this project, We'll design and conduct an experiment to see if we can increase quiz completion.

First, we'll explore the DS Lab applicant pool, and formulate a research question and hypothesis. Then we'll run our experiment and analyze the results. Finally, we'll build an interactive web application so that others can run the same experiment.

This project is an example ofÂ **A/B testing**, also known as a randomized controlled experiment. In the private sector, A/B tests are used to improve things like email marketing and product pricing. In politics, they can be used to test campaign messages. Scientists of all kinds use them in their research.

We were able to:
- Build aÂ **choropleth map**Â to show the distribution of ADSL students around the world.
- Create aÂ **custom Python class**Â to implementÂ **ETL processes**.
- Design an experiment and analyze the results using aÂ **chi-square test**.
- Build an interactive web application that follows aÂ **three-tiered design pattern**.

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks :
1. Meet the DS Lab Applicants
2. Extract, Transform, and Loa
3. Chi-square test
4. Experiment Web Application
5. Admissions in the MScFE ðŸŽ“ðŸ—ž
