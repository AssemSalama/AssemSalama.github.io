title: "Bankruptcy in Poland"
excerpt: "This project aims to create a predictive model for bankruptcy using financial data from Poland and Taiwan, sourced from the Emerging Markets Information Service. By identifying companies at risk of bankruptcy, it offers potential solutions for a wide range of stakeholders. Investors can make more informed investment decisions, financial institutions can better assess credit risk, and businesses can ensure more stable partnerships. Policymakers can enhance financial regulations, and researchers can gain insights into regional bankruptcy factors. Ultimately, this project addresses critical financial risk assessment needs and contributes to financial stability and decision-making in the targeted regions.<br/><img src='/images/Bankruptcy.jpeg' width='400px' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>"

In this project, you'll work with financial data from the Emerging Markets Information Service. You'll look at financial indicators from Poland and Taiwan and build a model that predicts bankruptcy.

We'll explore data collected by a team of Polish economists studying bankruptcy. Your goal is to build a model that can predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not.

### We were able to:      
- Navigate a file system from the Linux command line
- Load and save files using Python
- Address imbalanced data using resampling techniques
- Evaluate a model using classification metrics like precision and recall

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks:
1. Working with JSON files
2. Imbalanced Data
3. Ensemble Models: Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting Trees
5. Bankruptcy in Taiwan
