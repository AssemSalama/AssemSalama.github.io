title: "Customer Segmentation in the US"
excerpt: "This project, utilizing data from the 2019 Survey of Consumer Finances and employing unsupervised learning techniques, aims to identify and segment households struggling to access credit. The business case extends to various sectors: financial services can tailor products, marketing can target specific consumer segments, credit scoring can become more precise, policymakers can enhance financial inclusion initiatives, and social researchers can gain insights into socioeconomic disparities. Ultimately, this project has the potential to improve financial access, customer engagement, and informed decision-making across industries while addressing the challenges faced by underserved households.<br/><img src='/images/Customer Segmentation.jpeg' width='400px' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>"

In this project, we'll use data from theÂ [2019 Survey of Consumer Finances](https://www.federalreserve.gov/econres/scfindex.htm). First, you'll identify households that have a hard time getting credit. Then we'll build a model to segment these households into subgroups. Finally, you'll create an interactive web app to share our work.

This project is an example ofÂ **unsupervised learning**, specificallyÂ **clustering**. It can be used in commercial contexts forÂ [marketing or customer segmentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Market_segmentation)Â or in sociological contexts to studyÂ [social stratification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_stratification).

### We were able to:      
- Compare characteristics across subgroups using aÂ **side-by-side bar chart**.
- Build aÂ **k-means**Â clustering model.
- ConductÂ **feature selection**Â for clustering based on variance.
- Reduce high-dimensional data usingÂ **principal component analysis (PCA)**.
- Design, build and deploy a DashÂ **web application**.

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks:
1. Exploring the Data
2. Clustering with Two Features
3. Clustering with Multiple Features
4. Interactive Dashboard
5. Small Business Owners in the United StatesðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸
