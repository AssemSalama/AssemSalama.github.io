title: "Market Forecasting in India"
excerpt: "This is providing a tool for financial professionals and investors to predict and manage stock market volatility in the Indian market. By creating a model to forecast volatility, individuals and organizations can make more informed investment decisions and potentially reduce the financial risks associated with market fluctuations. This can be particularly valuable for traders, portfolio managers, and investors looking to optimize their strategies and minimize losses.1<br/><img src='/images/CBOE Volatility Index.jpeg'>"

> you'll create a model to predict stock market volatility in India and then deploy your model as a web server.
> 
> 
> In this project, you'll build a model to predict volatility on the Bombay Stock Exchange.
> 
> First, you'll explore stock data for two companies using theÂ [AlphaVantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/)Â stock API. Then you'll use that data to calculate volatility and build a model to predict it. Finally, you'll deploy your model by creating your very own API to serve predictions.
> 
> Volatility models are used in econometrics and financial engineering. Also, this project uses time series data, so it'll be a good chance to cement what you learned in Project 3.
> 
> Once you complete this project, you'll be able to:
> 
> - Get data from a web API by makingÂ **HTTP requests**.
> - Transform and load data into aÂ **SQL database**Â usingÂ **custom Python classes**.
> - CalculateÂ **asset volatility**Â and build aÂ **GARCH model**Â to predict it.
> - Build your ownÂ **web API and server**Â to serve your modelâ€™s predictions.
> 
> This project consists of 5 Notebooks :
> 
> **1. Working with APIs**
> 
> **2. Test-Driven Development**
> 
> **3. Predicting Volatility Via GARCH**
> 
> **4. Model Deployment**
>
