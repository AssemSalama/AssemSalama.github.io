In this project, you'll work with financial data from the Emerging Markets Information Service. You'll look at financial indicators from Poland and Taiwan and build a model that predicts bankruptcy.

We'll explore data collected by a team of Polish economists studying bankruptcy. Your goal is to build a model that can predict whether a company will go bankrupt or not.

### We were able to:      
- Navigate a file system from the Linux command line
- Load and save files using Python
- Address imbalanced data using resampling techniques
- Evaluate a model using classification metrics like precision and recall

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks:
1. Working with JSON files
2. Imbalanced Data
3. Ensemble Models: Random Forest
4. Gradient Boosting Trees
5. Bankruptcy in Taiwan
