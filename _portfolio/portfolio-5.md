title: "Earthquake Damage in Nepal"
excerpt: "This project presents a critical solution for assessing building damage caused by the Nepal 2015 Earthquake, benefiting disaster response and recovery. By analyzing data from Gorkha and Ramechhap districts through Open Data Nepal, it equips authorities and organizations with valuable insights for targeted interventions and resource allocation. Moreover, it supports the development of earthquake-resistant construction methods, strengthening the overall resilience of communities in these vulnerable areas.<br/><img src='/images/Earthquake in Nepal RGB color icon.jpeg' width='400px' style='display: block; margin: 0 auto;'>"

In this project, we worked with data from Open Data Nepal to build a model to predict building damage from the Nepal 2015 Earthquake. We primarily focused on data from the Gorkha district, with additional examples from Ramechhap.

### Some of the things you'll learn in this project are:
- How to get data by querying a SQL database.
- How to build a logistic regression model for classification.
- How to build a decision tree model for classification.
- How to incorporate ethical considerations into your model building.l

### This project consists of 5 Notebooks:
1. Wrangling Data with SQL
2. Predicting Damage with Logistic Regression
3. Predicting Damage with Decision Trees
4. Beyond the Model: Data Ethics
5. Earthquake Damage in Kavrepalanchok
